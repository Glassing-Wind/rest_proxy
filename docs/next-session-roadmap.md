# GraphRAG evaluation roadmap — revised 2026-09-06

## Decision and scope

Keep retrieval behavior fixed until paired investigations reveal a reproducible weakness.
The original sequence is revised because the remote Security workflow never reached
scanning: its Gitleaks Action requires an organization license. Running the pinned,
checksum-verified CLI exposes a historical credential finding. Do not merge while
revocation is unconfirmed. Do not silently baseline or rewrite history to turn CI green.

## 1. Resolve release readiness

- `codex/enterprise-hardening` was clean and already current at `b05363c`.
- Remote CI for that revision passed (run 34045220918); Security failed (34045220901).
- Replace the licensed Action wrapper with the MIT-licensed Gitleaks CLI 8.30.1,
  verify the release archive SHA-256, scan all fetched history, and redact output.
- A Tavily-shaped credential was found in historical commit
  `04667ea6a080c8290926884d5d5ac79d74693fbb`, `session-ses_2b4d.md:768`.
  The file is absent from the current checkout. The user confirmed that revocation
  is not confirmed. Revocation/rotation is the next required owner action.
- After revocation, agree on narrowly scoped treatment of the historical finding;
  do not add an exception before then. History rewriting requires a coordinated plan.
- Update PR #1 with this session's concrete changes. The existing PR spans 232 files
  and over 53,000 added lines at the baseline; this session's targeted review is not
  a complete approval of that accumulated diff. Keep it unmerged.

## 2. Publish a paired pilot, then improve measurement

Run the existing 15 prompts in two fresh, non-inheriting agent contexts. Native uses
file/search tools; MCP uses brain tools with counted native fallbacks. Hold subject
source code at `b05363c`; record warm index health and setup independently.

Label this run a pilot: contexts share a machine, cases may be interleaved, MCP per-case
time measures tool latency while native measures end-to-end time, and token counts are estimates rather than model usage.
Do not claim end-to-end speed or token savings from these records. Correctness must
be reviewed against source; expected-evidence substring coverage is only a proxy.

Publish raw results, measurement methods, all 15 paired rows, and a case classification.
The comparator now records revision, token/timing method, and fallback counts and
rejects mismatched revisions and suppresses deltas for differing timing methods. CI validates and uploads the recorded
pilot; it does not rerun agents or impose blocking performance thresholds.

For a confirmatory run, capture runner-provided input/output usage, end-to-end timing,
actual tool logs, tool availability/model settings, and revision/index identity. Run
conditions sequentially with randomized order across repeated runs, keep grading
separate, and hide expected-evidence hints from investigating agents. Repeat with
cold/fresh, stale, and partial indexes and a second unfamiliar repository.

## 3. Select improvements from evidence

Use the pilot report to identify three priorities and cite repeated affected cases.
Treat isolated observations as hypotheses until reproduced. Separate retrieval
quality, output usability, tool selection, and index contamination. Implement behavior
changes in separate patches with regression cases and the retrieval-quality gate.

## 4. Prepare one dependency batch

The unbaselined audit reports 116 findings in 19 packages. Prepare only aiohttp,
python-multipart, and urllib3 in the first patch; defer MCP/Starlette upgrades to a
separate compatibility review. See `security/batches/2026-09-06-http-clients.patch`
and its README. Both requirement files and resolved baseline IDs move together.
Do not apply it to the live environment during measurement. Resolver/audit checks
are preparation, not runtime compatibility proof. Full CI and retrieval gates in
an isolated candidate environment remain required before adoption.

## 5. Operational cleanup

The brain dry run reports one shadow namespace with 4,478 nodes and 1,031
relationships. It does not expose the project ID in its response. Defer deletion
until measurements finish, the exact namespace is reviewed, and no active index
jobs are confirmed. Then dry-run again, clean, and verify all benchmark repositories.
Do not treat timestamp freshness alone as proof of an uncontaminated index.

## Stopping criteria

A complete, honestly labeled 15-pair pilot and three source-backed priorities;
reviewed CI fixes published to PR #1; a separate prepared dependency patch; and
explicit unresolved items for credential revocation, green Security, confirmatory
usage measurement, full PR review, and quiet-window graph cleanup.
